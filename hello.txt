# Steps and Commands Used:
#
# Step 1: I created a new repo on my github account

# Step 3: then i created a local folder on my desktop
# Step 4: I used "git remote add origin <repo url>" to connect my repo to the
# local folder
# Step 5: Then i created a text file ("hello.txt") using the "touch hello.txt"
# command
#
# Step 6: I used "vim hello.txt" to write into the file and save it using ":wq"
#
# Step 7: Then I used "git status" to see all my input yet to be committed
#
